# Hi, I'm Lachlan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer working from Brisbane, Australia ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º at [Visibuild](https://visibuild.com.au/?ref=lachlanyoung) specialising in React, React Native, GraphQL and Rails. 

Before Visibuild, I spent a year and a half working working remotely at [Calyptia](https://calyptia.com/?ref=lachlanyoung). Before Calyptia, I spent 3 years as a full-stack developer at [Tanda](https://tanda.co/?ref=lachlanyoung) and was responsible for a large part of the mobile app's development, engineering solutions to complex compliance issues and contributing to the thriving team culture, and before that.... check out my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/builtbyproxy)

Outside of work I'm both the proud founder of [HotHack ðŸ”¥](https://hothack.com/?ref=lachlanyoung) and [AuthNet](https://authnet.app/?ref=lachlanyoung), both of which I'd love your support and feedback on. I'm equally passionate about finding a solution to the gender diversity issues we see in Tech in an actionable way, so I regularly mentor for [SheCodes](https://shecodes.com.au/?ref=lachlanyoung) in React and Html/CSS. 

Did I mention I work in Brisbane, Australia ðŸŽ‰ If you ever find yourself in town and passionate about React, come along to the [ReactBris](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/reactbris/) meetup that I co-organise!
